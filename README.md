# Data Acquisition & Transformation
Repository from Data Acquisition and Transformation Course from Big Data Master.

The quality of any statistical model cannot be greater than the quality of the data it is based on. As a result, gaining the ability to gather
and cleanse data should be one of the first priorities of any data scientist student, and that is exactly what this course is all about.

In this repository there are some examples coded with Python where you can learn about HTTP requests, a quick overview about how to parse HTTP responses and some Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium.
